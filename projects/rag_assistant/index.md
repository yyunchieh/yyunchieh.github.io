# Assistant for Statistical Learning

## Overview
I developed a retrieval-augmented generation system using LangGraph to answer questions based on The Elements of Statistical Learning. The project combines AI and transparency-focused evaluation to support efficient learning and deeper conceptual understanding.

## Motivation
Learning a complex subject often requires flipping through hundreds of pages. I wanted to build a system that helps users interactively explore a textbook, obtain reliable answers, and understand the reasoning behind them. My goal was to balance AI capabilities with user trust and interpretability.

## Tech Stack & Methods
* RAG: LangGraph-based retrieval and generation
* LLM-as-a-Judge: Automated hallucination detection
* Tracing & Monitoring: LangSmith for full pipeline observability
* Interface: Streamlit for interactive web app
* Export: Markdown download for Q&A with citations
* Programming: Python

## Key Results 
* Successfully generated source-grounded answers to complex textbook questions
* Built automated hallucination evaluation metrics → measurable output reliability
* Provided interactive visualization of source citations and retrieval paths
