### Turn 6: Agent 2 (Perplexity)

You're absolutely right that AI's personalization potential is significant, but the implementation reality reveals critical gaps. The data shows that while 74% more schools provided AI training recently, **57% of schools and districts still haven't offered any training at all**, and educators continue citing lack of support as a major barrier[3]. Most concerningly, the disconnect between enthusiasm and readiness is stark: 55% of recent graduates felt unprepared to use AI tools in their careers, despite AI's growing classroom presence[2]. Without addressing the training infrastructure gap and ensuring equitable access across well-funded versus under-resourced districts, we risk widening rather than narrowing educational inequalities[5].
