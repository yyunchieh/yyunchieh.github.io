## About Me

Welcome to my personal website! I'm a research assistant specializing in **multi-agent systems** and interested in addressing problems with **data science** techniques, especially for complex social problems.

I’m passionate about building systems that enhance productivity. Currently, I work on streamlining research assistant workflows powered by **large language models (LLMs)** and evaluating their performance in real-world research tasks.
