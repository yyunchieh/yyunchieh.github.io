## About Me

Welcome to my personal website! I'm a research assistant specializing in **multi-agent systems** and interested in addressing problems with **data science** techniques, especially for complex social problems.

I’m passionate about building systems that enhance productivity. Currently, I work on streamlining research assistant workflows powered by **large language models (LLMs)** and evaluating their performance in real-world research tasks.

- **[LLM Evaluation with Phoenix](projects/llm_evaluation_phoenix/)**
  Systematic evaluation framework for LLM-based research assistants, measuring
  tool-calling reliability, hallucination rates, and factual accuracy. Addresses
  the gap between fluent outputs and academic credibility.
  **Tech:** Python, Arize Phoenix, LangChain, Streamlit
  [GitHub](https://github.com/yyunchieh/LLM-Evaluation-with-Phoenix)  | [Demo Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvZ2b9byQJc)

- **[RAG Assistant for Statistical Learning](projects/rag_assistant/)**
  An interactive Q&A system using LangGraph to answer questions from *The Elements
  of Statistical Learning*. Features automated hallucination detection via
  LLM-as-a-judge and full pipeline observability with LangSmith.
  **Tech:** Python, LangGraph, LangSmith, Streamlit, RAG

- **[Exploring Socioeconomic Correlates of Taiwan’s Voting Behavior](projects/taiwan_voting_behavior/)**
  Interpretable ML analysis of Taiwan's 2024 presidential election examining how
  demographics, economics, and education influence voting patterns across 20
  districts. Used SHAP and clustering to identify district typologies for
  campaign strategies.
   **Tech:** Python, SHAP, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, PCA, K-Means clustering, ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
  [GitHub](https://github.com/yyunchieh/Analysis-of-Voting-Behavior-in-Taiwan)
  
- **[Multi-Agent Conversation with Automated Summarization](projects/multi_agent_interaction/)**
  LangGraph system enabling structured discussions between multiple LLMs
  (GPT-4o and Perplexity Sonar) with periodic summarization. Demonstrates
  coherent cross-model communication for social science applications.
  **Tech:** LangGraph, Multi-model orchestration
